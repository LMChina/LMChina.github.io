**Title:** Physics-informed Temporal Convolutional Network with Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit developed for rapid prediction of seismic response time-histories of building structures

**Authors:** Mao Li and Yong Li

Our new paper introduces a physics-informed deep learning framework, **PhyTCN-BiGRU**, for rapid and accurate prediction of nonlinear seismic response time-histories of building structures across different hazard levels. Unlike many surrogate models that focus only on peak responses, this framework is designed to capture full response histories, including challenging residual displacements.

By integrating temporal convolutional networks with bidirectional gated recurrent units and enforcing equation-of-motion constraints, the model preserves physical consistency while learning complex path-dependent hysteretic behavior. Validation on both a Bouc-Wen system and a nonlinear four-story steel frame shows high accuracy for full histories and key engineering demand parameters under low- and high-intensity earthquakes.

The proposed framework provides an efficient and reliable surrogate for performance-based seismic assessment and design.
