  abstract = {Rapid and accurate prediction of structural response histories across multiple seismic hazard levels is essential for seismic performance and resilience evaluation. While surrogate modeling for peak values of individual responses has emerged as a popular solution, existing approaches often struggle to predict time-history-related quantities, particularly permanent residual displacements, due to highly nonlinear hysteretic behaviors during earthquakes. To address this, this study presents a surrogate model development framework for predicting seismic response time-histories using a physics-informed temporal convolutional network integrated with bidirectional gated recurrent units, referred to as PhyTCN-BiGRU. Through enforcing physical consistency through equation-of-motion constraints, the proposed framework effectively captures complex path-dependent dynamics. Validated on a Bouc-Wen system and a nonlinear four-story steel frame, the model demonstrates superior accuracy in predicting full time-history responses, including peak and residual demands, under varying seismic intensities. PhyTCN-BiGRU demonstrates strong capability in reproducing nonlinear seismic response time-histories under earthquakes with both low and high intensities. Critical engineering demand parameters (EDPs) are predicted with exceptional accuracy. The results confirm that PhyTCN-BiGRU offers a reliable and computationally efficient surrogate for seismic response history prediction, including peak and residual values, which can be further used for performance-based seismic assessment and design.},

  abstract = {High-rise buildings are susceptible to low-frequency vibrations induced by wind loading, and the traditional constant damping viscous damper (CDVD) falls short in effectively suppressing vibrations of high-rise buildings under wind loadings because of its constant damping coefficient. To address this, a novel variable damping viscous damper (VDVD) is first designed and fabricated. The characterization tests were conducted to evaluate the variable damping characteristics under different velocities. The control performance of the VDVD in high-rise buildings under wind loadings with varying wind pressures is simulated and analysed, as comparisons with CDVD. The test results show that the damping coefficient of the VDVD increases with the input velocity. Furthermore, it exhibits the capability to achieve both constant and variable damping through the adjustment of the pre-pressure force in the spring. Compared with cases using CDVD, the VDVD demonstrates a significantly greater reduction in structural response, with cumulative dissipated energy ratios ranging from 1.0 to 3.14 as wind pressure increases. The VDVD offers excellent potential for various engineering applications in terms of new concepts and new devices for vibration control and mitigation induced by wind loadings.},

  abstract = {The application of traditional fluid viscous dampers was constrained by their typically constant damping coefficient, which produced a narrow range of damping force. To address this, this paper develops a novel variable damping viscous damper (VDVD) with the feature of variable damping coefficient and force in the passive control domain. The performance tests of VDVD under various loading velocities were carried out to investigate the variable damping characteristic. Simultaneously, tests were conducted to investigate the variable damping characteristics of two critical design parameters: the pre-pressure force of the spring and the shape of the damping orifice. Furthermore, the finite element (FE) model of the device was built using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method, and verification and parameter analysis were conducted. Through experimental study and finite element simulations, the design philosophy of VDVD was verified. Both experimental and FE analysis show that the shape of damping orifice and pre-pressure of spring will significantly affect the process and critical velocity of variable damping respectively. The residual area and shape of the damping orifice impact the magnitude of the damping force directly. This study offers a thorough comprehension for the design of VDVD which will promote the development of variable damping devices.},

  abstract = {Liquid storage tank (LST), as critical infrastructure in the petrochemical industry, is highly vulnerable to earthquake-induced damage, which may trigger secondary hazards such as fires and explosions. Seismic isolation has been widely recognized as an effective strategy to mitigate seismic impacts on LSTs. To achieve effective vibration control while preventing isolation system failure due to excessive displacement, a novel passive variable damping and stiffness device (PVDSD) was proposed. Performance testing verifies that the PVDSD delivers real-time variable damping forces responsive to velocity and provides stepwise stiffness activation upon excessive displacement within the isolation layer. Subsequently, the numerical model of PVDSD was developed and validated against test results. Integrated with lead-rubber bearings (LRBs), a new seismic isolation system was formulated and benchmarked against alternative isolation configurations under seismic excitations spanning four hazard levels. Five key engineering demand parameters (EDPs) including the isolation layer displacement, base shear, overturning moment, sloshing height and hydrodynamic force are evaluated and compared. Results demonstrate that the PVDSD isolation system exhibits a superior performance on energy dissipation under design-based earthquakes and effectively mitigates residual displacements under maximum considered and rare earthquake scenarios. Although marginal increases in base shear and sloshing height are observed, these remain significantly lower than those in non-isolated systems. In general, the PVDSD isolation system substantially enhances the seismic resilience of LSTs by providing robust energy dissipation ability at low- and middle-intensity earthquakes and improved overturning resistance at high-intensity.},

  abstract = {Accurately assessing the maximum moment resistance of steel bolted T-stub connections under cyclic loading is crucial for designing earthquake-resistant structures with such connections. Traditional methods based on design standards like ASCE 41-17 often lack precision. Recently, supervised machine learning techniques, particularly Artificial Neural Network (ANN), have been explored. However, conventional ANNs require substantial data for generalization, which is limited for steel bolted T-stub connections. To address these challenges, this study explores the feasibility of using the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to predict the maximum cyclic moment resistance of steel bolted T-stub connections. MAML adapts task-specific model parameters rapidly and transfers knowledge across tasks to fine-tune global model parameters, potentially enhancing prediction accuracy with limited data. The MAML model is first optimized using Bayesian optimization with a Gaussian Process model to identify ideal hyperparameters. The optimized MAML model is then compared with two ANN models (one with optimized hyperparameters, another matching MAML's neural network architecture) and ASCE 41-17 method. Results demonstrate the optimized MAML model's superior generalization capabilities, offering a promising approach for steel bolted T-stub connections.},

  abstract = {The nonlinear behavior of steel beam-column bolted T-stub (BCBT) connections under cyclic loading can potentially be represented using the Pinching4 model in OpenSees. However, its application is limited by the lack of parameter specifications tailored to these connections, particularly for parameters controlling pinching effects and stiffness degradation, which are not directly observable from experimental data. Manual calibration of these parameters is challenging due to the model's implicit nature and high-dimensional parameter space. To address these challenges, this study (1) proposes a novel calibration approach by combining Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) to calibrate the Pinching4 model parameters for tested specimens available in the literature, and (2) develops predictive models for specifying parameters for future use of the Pinching4 model for steel BCBT connections. Specifically, PCE is utilized to approximate the discrepancy between the Pinching4 model predictions and experimental data to reduce computational cost, while GA is employed for its robust global search capabilities in optimization tasks. Furthermore, Elastic Net (ENet) regression is used to develop predictive models for the Pinching4 model parameters for untested connections, effectively handling high-dimensional features and small sample sizes, thereby mitigating multicollinearity and overfitting issues. The resulting regression models demonstrate favorable predictive performance, enhancing the accessibility and practical application of the Pinching4 model in modeling the moment-rotation hysteretic behavior of untested steel BCBT connections.},

  abstract = {The utilization of partially-restrained (PR) steel beam-to-column bolted T-stub connections offers a promising avenue for enhancing the efficiency and resilience of steel structural systems by reducing material consumption and facilitating post-hazard rehabilitation of connection components. However, the practical application of PR T-stub connections faces challenges due to the lack of comprehensive design guidelines. Specifically, in the context of performance-based seismic design for structural systems featuring PR T-stub connections, the accurate characterization of the cyclic envelope is pivotal. Presently, the availability of dependable cyclic envelope models tailored to PR T-stub connections is limited, with existing models facing various limitations. In response to these challenges, this study aims to pioneer a more dependable envelope model capable of mitigating the shortcomings of existing models. To achieve this objective, a comprehensive database comprising experimental data from steel beam-to-column assemblages with T-stub connections subjected to cyclic loading is compiled. These assemblages feature T-stubs either cut from hot-rolled sections or fabricated by welding plates, while the connected beams and columns are hot-rolled members. A four-stage multi-linear cyclic envelope is then developed. Particular attention is given to determining the two key characteristics of PR T-stub connections: maximum strength and initial rotational stiffness. The accuracy and robustness of the developed envelope model are rigorously assessed through comparisons with both experimental results and predictions from existing envelope models.},

  abstract = {The traditional passive base isolation is the most widely used method in the engineering practice for structural control, however, it has the shortcoming that the optimal control frequency band is significantly limited and narrow. For the seismic isolation system designed specifically for large earthquakes, the structural acceleration response may be enlarged under small earthquakes. If the design requirements under small earthquakes are satisfied, the deformation in the isolation layer may become too large to be accepted. Occasionally, it may be destroyed under large earthquakes. In the isolation control system combined with rubber bearing and magnetorheological (MR) damper, the MR damper can provide instantaneous variable damping force to effectively control the structural response at different input magnitudes. In this paper, the control effect of semi-active control and quasi-passive control for the isolation control system is verified by the shaking table test. In regard to semi-active control, the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) classical linear optimal control algorithm by continuous control and switch control strategies are used to control the structural vibration response. Numerical simulation analysis and shaking table test results indicate that isolation control system can effectively overcome the shortcoming due to narrow optimum control band of the passive isolation system, and thus to provide optimal control for different seismic excitations in a wider frequency range. It shows that, even under super large earthquakes, the structure still exhibits the ability to maintain overall stability performance.},

A 4-story SMRF building is designed and modeled in OpenSeesPy with and without MIWs. A total of 1,500 nonlinear time-history analyses (NLTHAs) are performedacross 15 hazard levels, and structural demands are evaluated in terms of inter-story drift ratio(IDR). Fragility functions are developed for three performance levels. The results reveal thatMIWs significantly reduce IDR with average reductions of up to 55%. Moreover, the inclusionof MIWs greatly improves fragility performance, lowering the probability of exceeding criticalperformance levels.},
