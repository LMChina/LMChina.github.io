<p style="text-align: justify;">
Welcome to my personal website! I am Mao Li, a Ph.D. student in Structural Engineering at the University of Alberta, where I am a part of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/ualberta.ca/smra-yongli">Structural Modeling and Reliability Analysis (SM&amp;RA) Research Group</a> led by <a href="https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/yong9">Dr. Yong Li</a>. My work bridges the gap between traditional structural mechanics, artificial intelligence, and advanced control systems. Ultimately, my research aims to enhance the safety, resilience, and computational efficiency of our built environment against dynamic hazards.
</p>

**My research interests:**

- **Probabilistic Performance-Based Seismic Design (PBSD):** Developing comprehensive frameworks for evaluating the seismic vulnerability and resilience of building structures under earthquake loading.
- **AI for Structural Engineering:** Developing machine learning and deep learning surrogate models, such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks, to significantly accelerate nonlinear time-history analysis, enhance overall seismic risk assessment, and directly facilitate PBSD frameworks.
- **Smart Structural Control & Damping Systems:** Designing and testing advanced adaptive systems, including variable damping devices, variable damping and stiffness devices, and inerter-based dampers with variable inertance.
- **Vibration Mitigation Applications:** Assessing the performance of control devices across diverse complex structures, including wind-induced vibration control for high-rise buildings, seismic protection for isolated liquid storage tanks, and anti-sway control for overhead cranes utilizing hook-integrated MR dampers.
- **Advanced Finite Element Modeling:** Conducting detailed, high-fidelity finite element analysis to evaluate the localized behavior and mechanics of structural components, such as steel beam-column connections.
- **Underground Infrastructure Resilience:** Conducting mechanical performance testing on utility tunnel connections and evaluating the comprehensive seismic performance of underground utility tunnel systems.
